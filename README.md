#AI Driven TRadiong Strategy with Real Time Data#
##Project background:##
This is the project that I used to promote myself into the Investment Club of USF. As a student majoring in Statistics and minor in Economics, I do recognize that there is one typical problem for traders nowadays which is to commit to "day trading". Day Trading is a one of the most profitable investing method nowadays which individuals can buy and sell the securities within the same day thanks to its fast - paced form of investing, However, a lot of traders struggle with time commitment and tend to lose track of their trading history which obviously results in a huge loss of money,
##Executive Summary:##
This project is to create an AI Strategy Bot with real Time Data. I have applied two main concepts into the way to function the AI: Volatility and "Buy Low Sell High".
The idea behind this trading bot is that: we will design algorithms to let the Bot run and track the fluctuation of the price in 3-month period, and whenever there is a peak in the price of chosen stock, the Bot will send the traders signals to whether buy or sell, and in vice versa with those situations when there is a bottom in a price.
##Insight- Deep Dive:##
###1. Equity Growth and Profitability###
The equity curve from 2009 to 2023 shows consistent growth in portfolio value, reaching $684,082 by 2025.
The net profit of $474,591.54 demonstrates strong profitability, with effective returns outpacing market fees.
While the growth is steady, the Sharpe ratio of 0.517 suggests that the bot’s returns are not optimally risk-adjusted. A Sharpe ratio above 1.0 is typically considered good, indicating that the strategy may take on a higher level of risk relative to the returns it generates.
###2. Portfolio Turnover###
The portfolio turnover chart suggests a low trading frequency, except for a notable spike around 2015. This low turnover indicates that the trading strategy is focused on maintaining positions for longer periods, reducing transaction costs and potentially enhancing net profits.
###3. Drawdown Behavior###
The drawdown chart illustrates periods of equity decline, with significant drops observed around 2020-2025, reaching as low as -24%. This highlights that, while profitable, the strategy experiences volatility in returns, which aligns with the relatively low Sharpe ratio. The higher drawdowns could be impacting the risk-adjusted performance.
The pattern of drawdowns shows some recovery, but the frequent dips in equity suggest the model could benefit from improved risk management during high-volatility periods to minimize losses.
###4. Volatility, Risk, and Sharpe Ratio###
The Sharpe ratio of 0.517 suggests that the trading strategy is delivering returns with a moderate level of risk, but it’s not achieving optimal risk-adjusted performance. The bot may be generating returns, but with significant volatility, leading to lower overall efficiency in balancing risk and reward.
This ratio highlights a potential area for improvement: the strategy could benefit from incorporating more sophisticated risk management techniques or adjusting its exposure during volatile market conditions to improve the risk-return profile.
